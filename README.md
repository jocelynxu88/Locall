# Locall

A Flutter project that helps the community, one call at a time.

## What it does
Locall helps members of a neighbourhood get in contact and share any tasks that they may need help with. Users can browse through these tasks, and offer to help their neighbours. Those who post the tasks can also choose to offer payment for these services. It's hard to trust just anyone to help you out with daily tasks, but you can always count on your neighbours!

For example, let's say an elderly woman can't shovel her driveway today. Instead of calling a big snow plowing company, she can post a service request on Locall, and someone in her local community can reach out and help out! By using Locall, she's saving money on fees that the big companies charge, while also helping someone else in the community make a bit of extra money. Plenty of teenagers are looking to make some money whenever they can, and we provide a platform for them to get in touch with their neighbours.
